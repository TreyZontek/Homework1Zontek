PART 1 - Websites

1 - Morecast
https://morecast.com/en/plan-your-route
This website has the same premise as my idea but our feature ideas differ.
My idea is more of a user input sort of based on filters for searching databases like autotrader.
You can put a range of temperature, how often it snows/rains, landscape details (mountains/oceans) , and more for my idea, kinda like car shopping. 
However for this site it primarily has you choose your location you are looking to vacation or travel to and then shows you the weather data/radar for that location. 
As well as showing you your driving route and what weather you would encounter in route to your destination. 
Although we have the same general idea my mind and there development team are taking different approaches. While the idea of showing the weather on the way to your destination you choose
as well as when you arrive what the weather will be like for the following week being displayed is something I would like to emulate.
2 - Whereandwhen
https://www.whereandwhen.net/
This site is far closer to what I am looking to create.
It has a slider allowing you to select temperature ranges, sea temps, budget, activities, and more. Then it shows you the best destinations for what you are looking for.
This is truly a website I will use to emulate what is best for my website. Although I do not like their layout I believe this is almost the exact idea I had in mind when planning my website.
3 - weatherbase
https://www.weatherbase.com/?msu=go
This site is the closest to what i want to emulate. 
Specifically with their “vacation finder” feature. While unfortunately this website seems to be somewhat out of service because when you enter what you want to search for it returns simply a 404 error code where the second page does not exists, but its explanation of what the feature was intended to do is exactly what I want to do. 
You enter your travel month, what weather you are looking for and then it would return travel destinations directly to you.

PART 2 - REPOSITORIES

1 - PLANMYTRIP / WWA
https://github.com/MireyNM/World_Weather_Analysis/blob/main/README.md?plain=1

This takes the same idea as what I have come up with and evolves on it. 
Not only do they take search criterias and suggest vacation spots; They also suggest hotels and other lodging destinations. 
They give this information to the user by giving them a google map with pins to show exactly where each destination is located. This is exactly what I took away from the read me is they want to take search criterias and easily show the customer what they are looking for in a map rather than some long list and this is something I may attempt to add to my website.


2 - World Weather Analysis
https://github.com/bishopce16/World_Weather_Analysis/blob/main/README.md

This repository is someone with the same project as the first repository. 
However they took a slightly different approach in design for theirs. 
As well as a very simplified readME. 

Part 3
I believe I have covered all requirements for assignment 2.
I have include a link to as econd webpage
as well as bootstrap integration and all other required pieces for this assignment.

Part 4
This is part 4 :)

REFERENCES
To construct my Javascript code portion I used the help of chatgpt with the following prompt
"Create me a button in javascript coding language that hides the second column of a table"

This was too simple and required me to then ask it to add a second button that reenabled the second column as the only feature it added was
a hide column buttons.
"Now please add a button to this code that reenables the second column"
